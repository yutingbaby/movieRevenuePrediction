# TMDB Box Office Prediction: Predict Movie Revenue
This is a predictive project I did in R. The objective of the project is to predict movies' revenue by using some features of movies. 

In this TMDB Box Office Prediction project, We aimed at predicting the revenue for movies using some attributes of movies. We tried several techniques including random forest, text mining, extreme gradient boosting, clustering, neural network, and SVM. Finally, we learned that xgboost with text mining is the best one. 
We found that the most important variables that influence a movieâ€™s revenue are budget, popularity, number of casts & crews and sentiments in a movie overview description. In conclusion part, we recommended several ways for movie producers to generate higher revenue.
