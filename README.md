# TMDB Box Office Prediction: Predict Movie Revenue
### project 2
### Programming Language: R

#### Overview:
In this TMDB Box Office Prediction project, We aimed at predicting the revenue for movies using some attributes of movies. We tried several techniques including random forest, text mining, extreme gradient boosting, clustering, neural network, and SVM. Finally, we learned that xgboost with text mining is the best one. 
We found that the most important variables that influence a movie’s revenue are: budget, popularity, number of casts & crews and sentiments in a movie overview description. In conclusion part, we recommended several ways for movie producers to generate higher revenue.


#### Statement of the problem or question(s) being addressed
Nowadays where movies made nearly $12 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? Or the genres? These are the questions we would like to answer.
For this project, we studied metadata on over 7,000 past films and applied EDA and predictive analysis. Some of our variables are numeric, and some are texts. 
The goal of our project is to find out the important factors that would influence a movie’s revenue, and build a predictive model to forecast a movie’s revenue. The error measure we used is rmsle. Generally speaking, smaller rmsle means smaller error and better accuracy. With the help of our analysis, the production companies will be able to enhance a movie’s revenue by making adjustments to relevant factors, such as release data, and control the risk of producing movies.
